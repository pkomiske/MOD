# MOD

This repository contains analysis code for studies conducted with CMS Open Data. Each top-level folder corresponds to a "collection" of datasets that have been culled from various Open Data records. Currently, the only collection is **CMS2011AJets**, which utilizes the Jet Primary Dataset from Run 2011 A.

Each collection contains a version of MODProducer and MODAnalyzer used for that analysis, as well as auxilliary files containing information needed for the analysis. Select a collection to get started and read about the analysis in more detail.
