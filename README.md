# MOD

This repository contains analysis code for studies conducted with CMS Open Data. Each top-level folder corresponds to a "collection" of datasets that have been culled from various Open Data records. Currently, the only collection is **CMS2011AJets**, which utilizes the [Jet Primary Dataset from Run 2011 A](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/21) and associated simulated datasets. See [the Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/3340205#.XV8GIJNKjUI) for our processed version of the Jet Primary Dataset as well as links to the records of the simulated datasets.

Each collection contains a version of MODProducer and MODAnalyzer used for that analysis, as well as auxilliary files containing information needed for the analysis. Select a collection to get started and read about the analysis in more detail.
